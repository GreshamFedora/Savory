# Savory
A food-focused social media app where users can post pictures and recipes of their favorite foods, interact with the public recipes others share, and search for recipes based on ingredients.

## How It's Made
**Tech Used:** CSS, JavaScript, Handlebars, Express as a framework for Node.js

This web app began as a simple program where users were able to document text-based content, originally just stored in a database and visible on their personal profile. Using MVC, our next step was to create a scrolling public feed, similar to modern social media sites, where users could view their own content and other users' content in a chronological order. From there, our team has been working on implementing an image upload feature using the CKEditor Ecosystem.

## Optimizations

Our team looks forward to implementing a section for a recipe's origin within each post, the ability to search for recipes posted by a specific user, and a successful image upload functionality with the CKEditor.

## Lessons Learned

Through creating this web-based social media app, we navigated working with a new team of talented engineers and learned how to come together as a community to delegate tasks and depend on each other depending on each dev's area of expertise. Working to create a project using the MVC architectural paradigm was an opportunity for growth, and as we troubleshooted each feature we developed a more well-rounded understanding of middleware, what it entails, and its capabilities.
